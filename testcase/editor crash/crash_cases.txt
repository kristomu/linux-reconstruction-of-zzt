EDCRASH2.ZZT	Crashes the editor upon invoking board info, due to a reference
		to a neighboring board that doesn't exist.

EDITOGGL.ZZT	Crashes the editor if it's patched to make editing P1 and P2
		above 10 possible but it doesn't check that the output is
		below 128 in certain cases (e.g. Duplicator P1 setting).
