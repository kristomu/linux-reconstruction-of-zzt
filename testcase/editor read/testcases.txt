PASSREAD.ZZT	Human-understandable instance of a bug where going to a new
		board as part of the stat-editing process (usually when editing
		a passage) causes reads from unallocated memory if the item
		with stats happens to have data. fuzzt doesn't trigger this
		one though.

R1.ZZT		fuzzt-triggerable version of the above. Valgrind will complain
		about reads from unallocated memory.
