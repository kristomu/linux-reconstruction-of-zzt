CR1-CR4: Garbled metadata or too small board size.
CR5: Duplicator without stats causes getStatIdx to return -1 and thus access
memory outside of bounds.
CR6: DataLen a very high positive number, leading to an out of bounds read.
CR7: DataLen zero leading to a free-without-alloc in RemoveStat (play to 
exercise the bug).
CYCLE0: Transporters and players with cycle 0 crash and hang the game respectively.
TRANSTEP: Transporters with very large xstep,ystep crash the game.
CR8: Too large BoardLen (exceeding the size of the game file).
