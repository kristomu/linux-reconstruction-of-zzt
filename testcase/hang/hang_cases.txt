CYCLE0: The first stat has cycle 0, which freezes the title screen because a cycle-0 object is never executed, and if monitor doesn't execute, the game is unresponsive.
PLAYER0: Putting the player stat at (0,0) causes a hang. (0,0) is outside of
the visible board, and any message will destroy the objec there - the player
or the monitor.
SCROLL: Touching a scroll and making the parser read the last byte, and that
last byte being #, hangs the game. See the file for more info.
ZAPVOID: Playing and then getting zapped with re-entry if zapped set outside of
bounds causes a hang because ZZT can't place the player on the board again.
DUPDOOM: Duplicating an idle transporter onto the player hangs the game.
EVERZAP: Fooling a blinkwall into repeatedly zapping a player clone while
thinking it's the real player hangs the game.
