CONVEYOR.BRD	Example of conveyor stat overwriting bug

NOSTAT.ZZT	A bunch of items without stats, to test behavior when GetStatId
		fails. Also, a transport next to the transport without stats
		(exercises another bug if you enter it from below), and a
		centipede (for fuzz testing purposes).

OVERFLOW.ZZT	A world with a title board that exceeds the 20k hard limit. May
		cause a crash or arbitrary behavior.

LTITLE.ZZT	A very long title makes editing annoying. Can possibly be used
		to read outside of allocated memory in certain cases (not shown
		here.)

LOCKED.ZZT	A Super Lock locked world with the last board corrupted by Super
		Lock. Use it to test if the last board can be recovered.

CHURN.ZZT	Allocates and deallocates lots of memory (2 MB) from repeatedly
		entering the board it exited. Crashes DOS ZZT with a heap 
		overflow.

INFLATE.ZZT	Tests the adding of stats to an almost-full (almost 20K)
		board. Allowing the stats to be added can cause a crash in
		BoardClose as the serialized representation overflows the
		buffer.

LEAK.ZZT	Demonstrates a memory leak in unpatched ZZT: AddStat checks
		whether a stat has data by using Data <> 0, but DataLen can
		still be zero with Data <> 0.

crash/		Worlds and boards that produce crashes
hang/		Worlds and boards that produce hangs/hard lockups
